  <h2>Research Guests</h2>
  We intend to create an open environment facillitating exchange within and beyond academia. If you are working on a
  project related to our research interests and wish to spend time in Saarbruecken to focus in this project, we will
  facilitate this by organizing space and sharing our expertize and ressources. Likewise, if you wish to contribute to
  existing projects we would be happy to host you and benefit from your expertise. People who have stayed with us as
  Research Guests in the past include Cedric Honnet, Rachel Freire, and Hannah Perner Wilson.

  <h2>Thesis Students</h2>
  Twice a year we offer a limited number of students the opportunity to write their thesis with us. The next cohort will
  start this September. We are still finalizing details, but will be open to applicants who come to us with a project,
  but will also announce topics here at a later time.
