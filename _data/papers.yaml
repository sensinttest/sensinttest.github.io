  - title: "Haptic Redirection: Modulating Hand Movement Speed with Vibrotactile Feedback"
    year: 2025
    authors: <b>Easa AliAbbasi</b>, <b>Nihar Sabnis</b>, <b>Yuran Ding</b>, <b>Nadine Wagener</b>, <b>Paul Strohmeier</b>
    venue: Mensch und Computer (MuC ’25)
    description: Redirecting user movement in Virtual Reality (VR) can expand perceived virtual space while accommodating limited physical space. Existing methods mainly rely on visual and auditory cues, but this work explores haptic cues as an alternative. Inspired by how vibrations arise when fingers move across textured surfaces—depending on scanning speed and surface properties—the authors manipulate vibrotactile feedback to influence movement speed. Across three psychophysical experiments, they show that (1) vibrotactile properties affect human movement speed, (2) movement remains stable if users consciously notice feedback changes, and (3) when users remain unaware, reducing vibration pulses by 50% increases movement speed by ~20%. These findings highlight the potential of vibrotactile feedback for subtle redirection in VR without relying solely on vision or sound.

  - title: "Sensorimotor Devices: Coupling Sensing and Actuation to Augment Bodily Experience"
    year: 2025
    authors: <b>Paul Strohmeier</b>, Laia Turmo Vidal, <b>Gabriela Vega</b>, <b>Courtney N. Reed</b>, Alex Mazursky, <b>Easa AliAbbasi</b>, Ana Tajadura-Jiménez, Jürgen Steimle
    venue: Extended Abstracts of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA ’25)
    description: A new class of wearable devices is emerging—ones that tightly couple sensing and actuation to fundamentally reshape how we perceive and control our bodies. Unlike typical wearables that focus solely on tracking (e.g., fitness bands) or feedback (e.g., VR headsets), these “sensorimotor devices” fuse input and output in time, space, and modality. This tight coupling enables richer bodily experiences—evoking new senses of agency, presence, and self-perception. In this workshop paper, the authors explore this frontier, drawing from disciplines spanning HCI, Psychology, Neuroscience, and Engineering. They identify research gaps and propose new design principles for wearables that go beyond passive observation, actively shaping embodied experience through real-time motion-coupled feedback.

  - title: "Physical Compliance and the Compliance Illusion: The Importance of Action for Perception"
    year: 2025
    authors: <b>Easa AliAbbasi</b>, <b>Dennis Wittchen</b>, <b>Gabriela Vega</b>, <b>Paul Strohmeier</b>
    venue: IEEE World Haptics Conference (WHC ’25)
    description: The perception of an object’s compliance can be manipulated through the grain-based vibrotactile compliance illusion. Although this method has gained interest for creating virtual compliance, its perceptual mechanisms remain poorly understood. This work analyzes compliance estimates and pressure profiles from 12 participants exploring both physical and virtual compliance. The results reveal that virtual compliance is distinct from physical compliance, mediated by separate sensorimotor processes. These differences are shown in the non-additive nature of real vs. illusory compliance perception and the distinct exploratory actions participants use. The findings have implications for the design of augmented and virtual tactile reality systems, advance our understanding of the compliance illusion, and support closed-loop theories of tactile perception.

    year: 2025
    authors: <b>Nadine Wagener</b>, Paweł W. Woźniak, Daniel Christian Albensoeder, Yvonne Rogers, Leon Reicherts, Jasmin Niess
    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI ’25)
    description: Navigating emotional conflicts within relationships can be tough—many couples struggle to express feelings clearly, leading to misunderstandings and emotional distance. TogetherReflect is a multi-user VR experience that helps couples navigate these moments through collaborative 3D drawing. First, each partner visualizes their emotions related to a shared conflict in virtual space. Then, they enter each other’s emotional worlds for reflection and conversation, before coming together on a shared canvas to co-create and reaffirm their connection. The system offers guidance and prompts throughout to facilitate emotional depth and healthy communication. Evaluated with 10 couples (n=20), TogetherReflect showed strong potential to deepen emotional insight, enhance understanding, and strengthen relational bonds—pointing to a future where immersive VR can actively support conflict resolution in intimate relationships.

  - title: "The Self‑Care Technology Process Model (SCTpm): A Framework for Designing VR‑Based Self‑Care Technology"
    year: 2025
    authors: <b>Nadine Wagener</b>, Yvonne Rogers, Jasmin Niess
    venue: ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference (DIS ’25)
    description: Designing for ongoing engagement in Virtual Reality (VR) self-care and well‑being interventions presents several challenges. Current frameworks supporting designers in this task primarily focus on specific well‑being objectives, such as goal‑setting or self‑reflection, but often lack implementable design recommendations to enhance engagement and prevent lapsing. To address this gap, we propose the Self‑Care Technology Process Model (SCTpm), which builds on six prior studies on VR self‑care applications. The SCTpm is a framework for an intervention‑centred self‑care journey, providing targeted design recommendations tailored to evolving user needs and supporting sustained interaction. Evaluated by n=10 experts, the SCTpm demonstrates its potential to enhance the iterative design and evaluation cycles of VR‑based self‑care technologies, sensitising designers to create effective and more engaging systems. Findings further indicate that the SCTpm can provide valuable guidance for designers and researchers at different levels of expertise in developing innovative VR applications for self‑care.

  - title: "Motion-Coupled Asymmetric Vibration for Pseudo Force Rendering in Virtual Reality"
    year: 2025
    authors: <b>Nihar Sabnis</b>, <b>Maelle Roche</b>, <b>Dennis Wittchen</b>, Donald Degraen, <b>Paul Strohmeier</b>
    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '25)
    description: Realistic force feedback is essential for immersion in VR, but traditional vibrotactile methods fall short. Asymmetric vibrations can induce pseudo forces but introduce unwanted vibration, reducing realism. We propose - Motion-Coupled Asymmetric Vibration (MCAV), a novel algorithm that couples asymmetric vibrations with user motion, leveraging sensory attenuation to mimic self-generated sensations. Studies showed that MCAV reduced perceived vibration by while maintaining the force sensation compared to continuous asymmetric vibrations. Demonstrations in VR scenarios—archery, weightlifting, and haptic magnets—showed user preference for motion-coupled asymmetric vibration offering a new direction for force rendering in VR.

    year: 2025
    authors: <b>Dennis Wittchen</b>, Alexander Ramian, <b>Nihar Sabnis</b>, Richard Böhme, Christopher Chlebowski, Georg Freitag, Bruno Fruchard, Donald Degraen
    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '25)
    description: Collaborative design of vibrotactile experiences poses unique challenges in remote settings, where designers must clearly convey their intentions and iteratively develop and refine experiences—ideally in real-time. To address these challenges, we introduce CollabJam, a collaborative prototyping suite that supports synchronous remote design of on-body vibrotactile experiences. Our study highlights the importance of multi-sensory communication for effective idea exchange and the complex trade-offs involved in the flexible placement of actuators on the body.

    description: Jarrod and I built a multi-electron sleeve for his research into EMS stimulation. We then invited Rachel Freire to join us in designing an updated version of that sleeve. This paper discusses this process and uses this to discuss the general concept of wearability. It was ages in the making. as Jarrod said "... and all it took was three weeks of writing -- and three years of talking about what to write".

    description: This project developed from our interest in designing pressure input on the skin. We performed multiple experiments to better understand the overal space of providing pressure input on soft surfaces. One thing we noted is that our study setup generally produced much better results than the literature previously suggested. I advised on study design, and contributed to data analysis, framing and writing of the paper.

    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '21)
    description: Here we present a concept and prototype implementation of concurrent, computer-supported sketching and implementing of epidermal devices. In many ways this was one of the most complex systems I've ever worked on, as the interplay between all the elements from new materials (the gold ink we used and the various substrate options we worked with) to hacked sensing devices (the on-skin Anoto tracking) to mechanical engineering (the modified dual-purpose pen) turned out much more complex than anyone anticipated. My involvement included the evaluation (together with a large chunk of work which we ended up removing from the paper, hopefully to be published inthe future), conceptualization, framing and writing and simply making sure we don't get lost in the details.

    authors: Paul Strohmeier , Sebastian Boring and Kasper Hornbæk
    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'18)
    description: In this paper we explore rendering textures in 3D space. As our feedback system does not provide the counter-force one experiences when interacting with a surface texture, it is not clear how such mid-air textures might be perceived. We present a qualitative analysis of the experience of interacting with mid-air textures, and how input parameters influence this experience.

    description: Touch input on clothing is difficult as there are ample opportunities for unintentional activation. In this paper we present a simple fabric design that acts as both a resistive and a capacitive sensor. We present instructions on how to build it and we demonstrate that the resulting hybrid sensor is more robust than either resistive- or capacitive-only equivalents and that the additional information improves the detection of custom gestures.

    image_outline: true
    year: 2011
    authors: Frederike Kaltheuner, Paul Strohmeier
    venue: Maastricht Journal of Liberal Arts
    description: Frederike and I wrote this essay to point out that the model of distributive justice used by Shelley Kagan is based on a set of normative assumptions. It is therefore only ‘intuitive’ to people who share his assumptions. We demonstrate how his model would change if the initial assumptions change.

  - title: "What can Doodles on the Arm teach us about On-Body Interaction?"
    year: 2016
    authors: Paul Strohmeier, Juan Pablo Carrascal, Kasper Hornbæk
    venue: Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA)
    description: While on-body interaction is treated as a novel concept in HCI, we point out that it is not necessarily the case. One way in which on-body interaction is quite common is the habit of doodling or writing notes on one’s arm. We presented a survey that explores this practice, in hope that it may serve as inspiration for future HCI explorations.
