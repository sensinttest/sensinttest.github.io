  - title: "Skill Sleeves: Designing Electrode Garments for Wearability"
    year: 2021
    authors: Jarrod Knibbe, Rachel Freire, Marion Koelle, and <b>Paul Strohmeier</b>
    venue: Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI)
    description: Jarrod and I built a multi-electron sleeve for his research into EMS stimulation. We then invited Rachel Freire to join us in designing an updated version of that sleeve. This paper discusses this process and uses this to discuss the general concept of wearability. It was ages in the making. as Jarrod said "... and all it took was three weeks of writing -- and three years of talking about what to write".

    year: 2021
    authors: Marc Teyssier, Marion Koelle,  <b>Paul Strohmeier</b>, Bruno Fruchard, and Jürgen Steimle
    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '21)
    description: Marc Teyssier built another one of his creepy anthropomorphic objects. This time as a camera. He wanted to use it as commentary on how we design sensing technology. I was involved with the framing and writing of the paper.

    year: 2021
    authors: Bruno Fruchard, <b>Paul Strohmeier</b>, Roland Bennewitz, and Jürgen Steimle
    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '21)
    description: This project developed from our interest in designing pressure input on the skin. We performed multiple experiments to better understand the overal space of providing pressure input on soft surfaces. One thing we noted is that our study setup generally produced much better results than the literature previously suggested. I advised on study design, and contributed to data analysis, framing and writing of the paper.

    year: 2021
    authors: Narjes Pourjafarian, Marion Koelle, Bruno Fruchard, Sahar Mavali, Konstantin Klamka, Daniel Groeger, Paul Strohmeier, and Jürgen Steimle
    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '21)
    description: Here we present a concept and prototype implementation of concurrent, computer-supported sketching and implementing of epidermal devices. In many ways this was one of the most complex systems I've ever worked on, as the interplay between all the elements from new materials (the gold ink we used and the various substrate options we worked with) to hacked sensing devices (the on-skin Anoto tracking) to mechanical engineering (the modified dual-purpose pen) turned out much more complex than anyone anticipated. My involvement included the evaluation (together with a large chunk of work which we ended up removing from the paper, hopefully to be published inthe future), conceptualization, framing and writing and simply making sure we don't get lost in the details.

    year: 2020
    authors: Paul Strohmeier, Seref Gu¨ngo¨r, Luis Herres, Dennis Gudea, Bruno Fruchard, and Jürgen Steimle.
    venue: User Interface Software and Technology (UIST '20)
    description: This paper essentially implements the hypothetical system described in the 'practical implications' section of my thesis. I had lots of help on the hardware and example applications by some very talented students. Bruno designed the experiments together with me and implemented them. This paper is essentially a logical consequence of my 'Generating Haptic Textures' and 'Mid-Air Haptic Textures' papers.

  - title: "From Pulse Trains to “Coloring with Vibrations”: Motion Mappings for Mid-Air Haptic Textures"
    year: 2018
    authors: Paul Strohmeier , Sebastian Boring and Kasper Hornbæk
    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'18)
    description: In this paper we explore rendering textures in 3D space. As our feedback system does not provide the counter-force one experiences when interacting with a surface texture, it is not clear how such mid-air textures might be perceived. We present a qualitative analysis of the experience of interacting with mid-air textures, and how input parameters influence this experience.

    year: 2018
    authors: Paul Strohmeier, Jarrod Knibbe, Sebastian Boring and Kasper Hornbæk
    venue: Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI)
    description: Touch input on clothing is difficult as there are ample opportunities for unintentional activation. In this paper we present a simple fabric design that acts as both a resistive and a capacitive sensor. We present instructions on how to build it and we demonstrate that the resulting hybrid sensor is more robust than either resistive- or capacitive-only equivalents and that the additional information improves the detection of custom gestures.

    authors: Paul Strohmeier, Kasper Hornbæk
    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) 2017
    description: When we move our finger over a material, the structure of the fingertip and the structure of the material interact – they generate vibration. These vibrations are experienced as textures. In this paper we explore how properties of such vibrations map to experiences of texture.

It is therefore only ‘intuitive’ to people who share his assumptions. We demonstrate how his model would change if the initial assumptions change.

    year: 2016
    authors: Paul Strohmeier, Juan Pablo Carrascal, Kasper Hornbæk
    venue: Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA)
    description: While on-body interaction is treated as a novel concept in HCI, we point out that it is not necessarily the case. One way in which on-body interaction is quite common is the habit of doodling or writing notes on one’s arm. We presented a survey that explores this practice, in hope that it may serve as inspiration for future HCI explorations.
